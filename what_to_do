A Code Scanner is a separate Camera output (just like photo or video) that can detect a variety of machine-readable codes, such as:

QR: Square QR codes
Aztec: Square Aztec codes
Data Matrix: Square Data Matrix codes
Barcode (EAN): EAN-13 or EAN-8 Barcodes
Barcode (Code): Code-128, Code-39, or Code-93 Barcodes
Barcode (GS1): GS1 DataBar, GS1 DataBar Limited, GS1 DataBar Expanded, and their stacked versions
Barcode (other): Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF), ITF-14, UPC-E, or PDF-417 Barcodes
Setup
On iOS, the Code Scanner uses the platform-native APIs and can be used out of the box.

On Android, the MLKit Vision Barcode Scanning API will be used, and the model (2.2MB) needs to be included into your app first.

React Native
Expo
Inside your gradle.properties file, add the enableCodeScanner flag:

VisionCamera_enableCodeScanner=true

Usage
To scan codes, simply create a CodeScanner instance and pass it to the <Camera>:

Hooks API
Imperative API
const codeScanner = useCodeScanner({
  codeTypes: ['qr', 'ean-13'],
  onCodeScanned: (codes) => {
    console.log(`Scanned ${codes.length} codes!`)
  }
})

return <Camera {...props} codeScanner={codeScanner} />

The result of this will automatically be memoized.

Code result
The Code Scanner will call your onCodeScanned callback with all detected codes (Code), including their decoded string value, and their coordinates on the screen relative to subject area of the Code Scanner (the frame).

UPC-A vs EAN-13 codes
UPC-A is a special case to handle if you need to cater for it. Android's SDK officially supports UPC-A but iOS does not, instead they handle the code as EAN-13. Since EAN-13 is a superset of UPC-A, with an extra 0 digit at the front.

This means, the upc-a types are reported under the ean-13 umbrella type on iOS:

const codeScanner = useCodeScanner({
  codeTypes: ['upc-a'], // <-- ✅ We configure for 'upc-a' types
  onCodeScanned: (codes) => {
    for (const code of codes) {
      console.log(code.type); // <-- ❌ On iOS, we receive 'ean-13'
    }
  }
})

You will need to keep this in mind and do the conversion from EAN-13 to UPC-A yourself. This can be done by removing the front 0 digit from the code to get a UPC-A code.

Interleaved2of5 (ITF) and ITF-14
Interleaved2of5 (ITF) barcodes are supported by both, Android and iOS, where Android's SDK supports barcodes in ITF format with a minimum length of 6 characters.

ITF-14 is a sub type of interleaved2of5 which always encodes 14 characters. The ITF-14 type is only supported by iOS. If you want to have the restriction to 14 characters in Android as well, you have to handle this in your own code.









The react-native-camera-kit library provides functionality to control the flash mode of the device's camera.
Controlling Flash Mode:
To utilize the flash, the Camera component from react-native-camera-kit accepts a flashMode prop. This prop can be set to different values to control the flash behavior:
"auto": The flash fires automatically when necessary, based on lighting conditions.
"on": The flash is always on when capturing an image or video.
"off": The flash is always off.
"torch": The flash acts as a continuous torch, illuminating the scene.
Example Implementation:
JavaScript

import { Camera, CameraType } from 'react-native-camera-kit';

// ... inside your component's render method or JSX
<Camera
  ref={(ref) => (this.camera = ref)}
  cameraType={CameraType.Back} // or CameraType.Front
  flashMode="auto" // Set the desired flash mode
/>
Changing Flash Mode Dynamically:
To change the flash mode dynamically (e.g., with a button toggle), you would typically manage the flashMode in your component's state and update it based on user interaction.
JavaScript

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'react-native-camera-kit';
import { Button } from 'react-native';

const MyCameraComponent = () => {
  const [flashMode, setFlashMode] = useState('off'); // Initial flash mode

  const toggleFlash = () => {
    setFlashMode((prevMode) => {
      if (prevMode === 'off') return 'on';
      if (prevMode === 'on') return 'auto';
      return 'off'; // Cycle through off, on, auto
    });
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Camera
        ref={(ref) => (this.camera = ref)}
        cameraType={CameraType.Back}
        flashMode={flashMode}
      />
      <Button title="Toggle Flash" onPress={toggleFlash} />
    </>
  );
};

export default MyCameraComponent;
